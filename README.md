# TIME-SERIES-ANALYSIS-OF-AGRICULTURAL-DATA-WHEAT-RICE-AND-MAIZE
With decreasing food security around the world, crop yield forecasting is crucial for proper planning and policymaking in the agriculture sector of the country. The present study was undertaken to estimate the productivity of rice, maize, and wheat crops based on production variables using past yield records of India. The paper analyses the trend in terms of the production of wheat, maize, and rice across India. Maize and wheat crop yield data for the period of the recent 68 years (1950-51 to 2017-18) and Rice crop yield data for the period of 67 years (1951-52 to 2017-18) were used to develop yield forecasting models. The data was collected from the yearend book Agricultural Statistics at a Glance 2018 released by the Government of India, Ministry of Agriculture &amp; Farmers Welfare Department of Agriculture, Cooperation &amp; Farmers Welfare Directorate of Economics and Statistics. The variable year contains the financial year whereas the production is in terms of million tonnes. Time Series modeling and ARIMA models have been used to analyze and predict future data points. The purpose of this paper is to fit an ARIMA model on the production data of wheat, rice, and maize, and predict the future forecast for the next five years. Results indicate that the fitted ARIMA model predicts the data with a root mean square error of 6.050464, 4.050464, and 1.195115 for wheat, rice, and maize respectively.
